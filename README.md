This repository contains the files used for my assignment for JavaScript Basics and Syntax, Module 10 Lesson 1.

Completion Status: Assignment Complete

Overview:

In this assignment, I linked an HTML document to 2 separate JavaScript files with code to complete specific tasks. All tasks completed are notated 
prior to the code for the task. All results can be confirmed by viewing the console on the open HTML page. A copy of the list of tasks and their 
completion status can be found in the 'instructions.txt' file.
